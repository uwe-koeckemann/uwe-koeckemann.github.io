# Going Further: Examples

This section hopefully provided some idea of what AIDDL is about and how it can
be used.

1. Language: learn about the AIDDL language, how to write types, functions, and
   create interfaces
2. Core: learn about the core library and how it organizes and evaluates AIDDL
   data
3. Common: learn about default types and implementations of basic algorithms to
   solve problems.
4. Examples: full integrated AI systems build on the Common library.
