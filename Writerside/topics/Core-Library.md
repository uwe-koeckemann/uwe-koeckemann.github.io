# Core Library

This chapter covers the functionality of the core library in detail. Each 
core library should at least be able to:

- Represent terms
- Store entries and modules
- Evaluate terms
- Provide a library of basic functions on terms for evaluation

We aim to make naming across different libraries consistent so that
the same functionality should have similar names across all cores
(adjusted for recommended syntax of specific languages).
