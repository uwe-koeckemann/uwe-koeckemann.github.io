# Common Library

The common library implements AI and related algorithms 
and provides types. The idea is to have one comprehensive 
library that can offer its capabilities, e.g., via gRPC 
(see external libraries).

Overview of current content of the GIT repository
- Scala: most comprehensive and up-to-date.
- Java: older and not updated (ideally use Scala even in Java applications)
- Python (work-in-progress): contains types but might include some specific algorithms in the future
