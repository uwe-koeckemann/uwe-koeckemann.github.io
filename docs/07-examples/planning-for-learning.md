Data collection for machine learning may be complex or costly.  In this example
we assume we have a component that provide data goals (i.e., data deemed most
useful to a learning component). We then use a planner to collect data for the
learner and evaluate the models it can produce via cross-validation.  If the
performance of the model is good enough we stop.
